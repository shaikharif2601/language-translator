# Translation for Humans
A flexible FREE and UNLIMITED tool to translate between different languages in a simple way using multiple translators.



Motivation
==========

I needed to translate a text using python. It was hard to find a simple way to do it.
There are other libraries that can be used for this task, but most of them
are **buggy, not free, not supported anymore or complex to use.**

Therefore, I decided to build this simple tool. It is 100% free, easy to use and provide
support for all languages.

Basically, my goal was to integrate support for multiple famous translators
in this tool.


When you should use it
======================

- If you want to translate text using python
- If you want to get translations from many sources and not only one
- If you want to automate translations
- If you want to compare different translations


Installation
=============

Install the stable release:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install textblob

take a look at the docs if you want to install from source.
